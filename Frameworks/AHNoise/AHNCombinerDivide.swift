/**
 Combines two input `AHNTextureProvider`s by dividing their colour values by one another.
 
 The value of the output is calculated using: `output = input1.rgb / input2.rgb`.
 
 For example a pixel with a value of `0.3` when divided by another pixel with a value of `0.6` will result in a value of `0.5`.
 
 Resultant values larger than `1.0` will show as white, and lower than `0.0` will show as black. The division is done separately for each colour channel, so the result does not default to greyscale.
