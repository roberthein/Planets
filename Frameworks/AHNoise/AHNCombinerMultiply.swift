/**
 Combines two input `AHNTextureProvider`s by multiplying their colour values with one another. The result is at least as dark as the two inputs.
 
 For example a pixel with a noise value of `0.3` when multiplied by another pixel with a noise value of `0.6` will result in a noise value of `0.18`.
 
 The multiplication is done separately for each colour channel, so the result does not default to greyscale.
