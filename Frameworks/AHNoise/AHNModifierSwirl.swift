/**
 Takes the outputs of any class that adheres to the `AHNTextureProvider` protocol and swirls its output.
 
 The `angle` property defines how much to swirl the input in radians. The amount each pixel is rotated about the anchor is proportional to its distance from the anchor point.
 
 The result will be clipped to fit within the same frame as the input, the size of the canvas does not change. Corners may be clipped because of this, to avoid losing the corners, resize the canvas first by using an `AHNModifierScaleCanvas` object to provide more room for rotation.
 
 Values are interpolated to avoid pixellation.
 
 The centre point about which the swirl takes place can be defined by the `xAnchor` and `yAnchor` properties. These can vary from `(0.0,0.0)` for the bottom left to `(1.0,1.0)` for the top right. The default is (`0.5,0.5`).
 
 Where the rotation results in the canvas being partially empty, this can be either left blank by setting `cutEdges` to `true`, or filled in black if set to `false`.
 
 *Conforms to the `AHNTextureProvider` protocol.*
